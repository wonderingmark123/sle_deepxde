plan for following works

1
use rho0 to test the differential equation and deepxde
get the training points first and use those points for the training 
compare the result with the rho0

get more familiar with the deepxde and know how to change the data in the network


2 
use the result of odeint to get the initial network and then training this net with differential equation

what I want from NIe
Rho0 function with q and t
ode result of rho
